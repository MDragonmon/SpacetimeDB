# React Integration

> ⚠️ SpacetimeAuth is currently in beta, some features may not be available yet or may change in the future. You might encounter bugs or issues while using the service. Please report any problems you encounter to help us improve SpacetimeAuth.

This guide will walk you through integrating SpacetimeAuth into a React
